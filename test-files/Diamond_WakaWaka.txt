Fking like nobody
Sucking your whole body
Fking everyday at party
Clean bi--h playing dirty
Ooh!
Before the light cut
Light up the prey
And them we pop bottles
Malaysian things
Cause love is the thing that I have in ma heart
And its there for you
African queen that I need that I want everyday is all you

Kadaka kona
Mwendo wa kreti
Kwa nyama choma
Bao kila mechi
Ka Maradona
Mtoto kashawaka
I will sing alone
Uuuuuh lalala
Uuuuuh lalala
Uuuuuh lalala
Yes me sing alone
Uuuuh lalala
Uuuuh lalala
And we go like
Waka waka
Waka waka
Waka
Waka waka
Waka waka
Waka waka
Waka waka
Waka
Waka waka
Waka waka
